# homebridge-nodemcu-relay
#### A simple yet efficient way to integrate a homebridge-controlled relay into your home.

## What is it?

homebridge-nodemcu-relay allows for the cheap and easy control of a relay via [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge); opening a wide variety of use-cases including Gate/Garage openers, sprinkler control, lights on/off and far more.

## How does it work?

homebridge-nodemcu-relay provides an Arduino script designed to be flashed onto a NodeMCU. After successful flashing, you will be able to quickly and simply integrate it into your pre-existing homebridge setup with the use of an http plugin such as [homebridge-http](https://github.com/rudders/homebridge-http).

## Requirements

* [NodeMCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU) (Or another [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) based board)

* 3v Relay Module

* [Pin Header Cables](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connector-basics/pin-header-connectors) (To connect the NodeMCU to the relay module)

* Micro-USB cable (for flashing and power)

* A method for flashing the NodeMCU with Arduino scripts (NodeMCU method described [below](#how-to))

## How-to

1. First, follow [this](https://gist.github.com/Tommrodrigues/8d9d3b886936ccea9c21f495755640dd) gist which walks you through how to flash a NodeMCU using the Arduino IDE. The `.ino` file reffered to is the `NodeMCU-Relay.ino` file included in this repository

2. Assuming that you already have [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installation) set up, the next thing you will have to do is install the http plugin you want to use. It is recommended that you use [homebridge-http](https://github.com/rudders/homebridge-http) due to its stability and wide usage. To install [homebridge-http](https://github.com/rudders/homebridge-http), use the command:
```
sudo npm install -g homebridge-http
```

3. Below is the example `config.json` file which assumes that you want to use [homebridge-http](https://github.com/rudders/homebridge-http) to communicate with your NodeMCU and that you want to use the `SWITCH` [feature](#available-features):

```json
{
    "bridge": {
        "name": "Homebridge",
        "username": "CC:22:3D:E3:CE:30",
        "port": 51826,
        "pin": "031-45-154"
    },
   

    "accessories": [
        {
          "accessory": "Http",
          "name": "Lights",
          "on_url": "http://nodemcu.local/SWITCH=ON",
          "off_url": "http://nodemcu.local/SWITCH=OFF",
          "http_method": "GET"
        }
    ],

    "platforms": [
    ]
}
```

4. And that's it! The `config.json` example above will simply turn the relay either on or off depending on what you request due to the fact that `SWITCH` is listed as the action. If you want to do some other sort of action with the relay such as a momentary pulse, read the [Available Features](#available-features) section below.

## Wiring

Depending on which relay module you have, it will either be a `HIGH` activation relay or a `LOW` activation relay. The `NodeMCU-Relay.ino` script accommodates for both, providing two seperate pins depending on which type of relay ou have, follow the correct wiring diagram for you below:

## Available Features

As you can see from the `config.json` example above, the basic format of the HTTP request is `http://nodemcu.local/` followed by the action you wish to execute. 

Here is a table which shows you the available relay actions included with the `NodeMCU-Relay.ino` script in this repository which can be included in the `config.json` to control different types of appliances:

| Name | Full URLs | Description | Example Uses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Switch | `http://nodemcu.local/SWITCH=ON` `http://nodemcu.local/SWITCH=OFF` | Will simply turn on/off the relay permanently as per the Home app. | Lights, faucets and fans etc. |
| Momentary | `http://nodemcu.local/MOMENTARY=ON` `http://nodemcu.local/MOMENTARY=OFF` | Will activate the relay for a brief moment then deactivate after the amount of time specified in the `NodeMCU-Relay.ino` script. | Garages, gates and buzzers etc. |
| Modulation | `http://nodemcu.local/MODULATION=ON` `http://nodemcu.local/MODULATION=OFF` | Will activate then deactivate the relay constantly for the amount of time specified in the `NodeMCU-Relay.ino` script until turned off. | Lights and sprinkler systems etc. |

#### Web Interface

It is also worth noting that the script provides a web interface available at either `nodemcu.local` or the IP address of your NodeMCU. From the (very basic) web interface, you can control any of the features included in the script. However, it is importatnt to know that using the web interface to control the NodeMCU will NOT update the state in the Home app but can be useful if you have people in your home who do not have an Apple device.


## Other features

#### Integrating with a "command" plugin

Whilst the `NodeMCU-Relay.ino` script was designed to be interacted with by an http plugin; it _is_ possible to control the NodeMCU from a "command" type plugin such as [homebridge-garagedoor-command](https://github.com/apexad/homebridge-garagedoor-command) by using:
```
curl http://nodemcu.local/ACTION
```
Where `ACTION` is the action you wish to perform (e.g. `SWITCH=ON`).

#### Using only one action type

Whilst it is **highly** recommended to simply use the main `NodeMCU-Relay.ino` script due to its versatility due to the fact that it contains all of the action types; if you _do_ wish to only flash the NodeMCU with a specific action (i.e. Switch, Modulation or Momentary), you can find these individual scripts located in the "Other Scripts" folder in this repository. Note that if you use one of these scripts, you will not be able to utilise any of the other [available features](#available-features) apart from the one you have explicitly flashed onto the board.
